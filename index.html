<section>
	<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

	<p>
		Xamarin Forms is great if you want to develop apps for different mobile platforms. But when it comes to touch gestures, it is still very limited.<br />
		For more than a year they only had the TapGestureRecognizer. Although they did add some others lately, they still don't provide all information which you need.
		Furthermore the API which they use has been copied from iOS and is not what a .NET developer would expect.
	</p>

	<p>
		MR.Gestures tries to close that gap.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It adds <code>Down</code>, <code>Up</code>, <code>Tapping</code>, <code>Tapped</code>, <code>DoubleTapped</code>, <code>LongPressing</code>, <code>LongPressed</code>, <code>Panning</code>, <code>Panned</code>, <code>Swiped</code>, <code>Pinching</code>, <code>Pinched</code>, <code>Rotating</code> and <code>Rotated</code>
		events to each and every layout, cell and view and to the <code>ContentPage</code>.
		These events will be raised when the user performs the corresponding touch gesture on the element.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the <code>EventArgs</code> passed to the handlers you can see exactly what happened.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can work with the touch gestures completely from the .NET Standard / PCL project. The platform specific code is all done in MR.Gestures.
	</p>
</section>


<section>
	<h2 id="GettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>

	<p>
		If you just want to see how it works, then download the free <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample">GestureSample app from GitHub</a>.
		In this app you can see how all the elements use all events. You can change the code however you like, add break points and see what it does.
		You will find all the examples from here in the GestureSample and many more.
	</p>

	<p>To add MR.Gestures to your own app just follow these simple steps:</p>

	<ul class="task-list">
		<li><a href="#InstallWithNuget">Install MR.Gestures with NuGet</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Buy">Obtain a license key</a></li>
		<li><a href="#HowToConfigureTheLicenseKey">Configure the license key(s) in each platform specific project</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>And now you can use the new elements from the namespace <code>MR.Gestures</code>.</p>
</section>


<section>
	<h2 id="CodeSamples">Code Samples</h2>

	<p>All the elements which are usually in the <code>Xamarin.Forms</code> namespace can also be found in MR.Gestures. But those have additional event handlers and command properties.</p>

	<p>Adding the event handlers works the same way as in standard Xamarin Forms or WPF controls in both XAML and code.</p>

	<h3 id="EventsXAML">Event Handlers in XAML</h3>

	<p>To add the event handler in XAML you have to:</p>
	<ol class="task-list">
		<li>Add the namespace MR.Gestures from the dll</li>
		<li>Use the element from that namespace instead of Xamarin.Forms</li>
		<li>Add the handlers for the gestures you want to listen to</li>
	</ol>
	<p><img src="images/xaml.png" alt="Sample XAML" /></p>

	<p>Here on <code>LongPressed</code> the method <code>Red_LongPressed</code> should be called. The method must be defined in the code behind file like this</p>

	<div class="highlight highlight-csharp">
		<pre>    <span class="pl-st">void</span> Red_LongPressed(<span class="pl-st">object</span> sender, MR.Gestures.LongPressEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>BoxViewXaml.Red_LongPressed method called<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);
    }
</pre>
	</div>

	<h3 id="EventsCode">Event Handlers in Code</h3>

	<p>Of course you can do the same in code. Either with a lambda expression</p>

	<div class="highlight highlight-csharp">
		<pre>        <span class="pl-k">var</span> box1 = <span class="pl-s">new</span> MR.Gestures.BoxView { Color = Color.Red };
        box1.LongPressed += (s, e) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Code: Red LongPressed<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>); };</pre>
	</div>

	<p>or by assigning the method as a handler.</p>

	<div class="highlight highlight-csharp"><pre>        box1.LongPressed += Red_LongPressed;</pre></div>

	<h3 id="CommandsXAML">Commands in XAML</h3>

	<p>But IMHO if you want to write clean MVVM, then the view should be in XAML and the code behind empty. So instead of the event handlers you can also use commands in your view model and bind them to the respective properties.</p>

	<div class="highlight highlight-xml">
		<pre>    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">mr</span><span class="pl-ent">:</span><span class="pl-ent">BoxView</span> <span class="pl-e">Color</span>=<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Green<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
		<span class="pl-e">LongPressedCommand</span>=<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding LongPressedCommand}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
		<span class="pl-e">LongPressedCommandParameter</span>=<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Green<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>
	</div>

	<p>The properties for the commands are called like the events, just with <code>Command</code> appended. You can also define a parameter passed to the command with the <code>..CommandParameter</code> properties. If you suppress the <code>CommandParameter</code>, then the respective event args are passed to your command. In this case a <code>MR.Gestures.LongPressEventArgs</code> object.</p>

	<p>For the <code>Tapped</code>, <code>DoubleTapped</code> and <code>LongPressed</code> events you may not need the event args and defining a <code>CommandParameter</code> could make sense. But for the more complicated events you will always need the event args or you won't know what happened. E.g. it does not help to just know that an element has been swiped unless you also know in which direction. The <code>Direction</code> is contained in the <code>SwipeEventArgs</code>.</p>

	<h3 id="CommandsCode">Commands in Code</h3>

	<p>You can bind the commands in code too.</p>

	<div class="highlight highlight-csharp">
		<pre>        <span class="pl-k">var</span> box2 = <span class="pl-s">new</span> MR.Gestures.BoxView { Color = Color.Green };
        box2.SetBinding(MR.Gestures.BoxView.LongPressedCommandProperty, <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>LongPressedCommand<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);
        box2.LongPressedCommandParameter = <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Green<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;</pre>
	</div>

	<hr>

	<p>The syntax for binding in code is a bit complicated, therefore my favorite is using commands in XAML. You will also see this, when you look through the code in GestureSample. Although there are samples in all these categories, most of them are written in XAML and bound to commands.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2 id="Buy">Buy</h2>

	<p>
		MR.Gestures is licensed per app name.
		I.e. if your app has the same name on all platforms, you only need one license key.
		If you have different versions of your app with different names (e.g. different languages, customized for different clients or free and pro), then you need a separate key for each version.
	</p>
	<p>You can use it for as many developers on as many computers as you like.</p>

	<p>The price for one license is EUR 40,00 (+VAT).</p>

	<p>The payment process will be handled by MyCommerce. You will be forwarded to their site when you click the Buy button.</p>

	<form>
		<div class="form-group">
			<label class="control-label">
                Please enter the exact name of your app. This is case dependent including whitespaces.
                See the <a href="#HowToConfigureAppName">FAQs</a> on how to configure it.</label>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="input-group col-sm-8 col-lg-6">
					<input type="text" class="form-control" id="appName" placeholder="App Name">
					<span class="input-group-btn">
						<button class="btn btn-default" type="button" id="buyBtn">Buy</button>
					</span>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</form>

	<p>Once you purchased a license, instructions how to configure it will be displayed on the MyCommerce page. These instructions can also be found in the email they will send you and in the <a href="#HowToConfigureTheLicenseKey">FAQs</a>.</p>

	<p>If you forget to configure the license key properly, then all the events will still be raised, but the properties of the <code>EventArgs</code> will be empty. That may be enough for the tap and long press events, but not for the more complicated ones.</p>

</section>

<section>
	<h2 id="Documentation">Documentation</h2>

	<h3 id="Events">Events</h3>

	<p>You can handle fourteen different events with MR.Gestures.</p>

	<div class="table-responsive">
		<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Event</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

					<td>One or more fingers came down onto the touch screen.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					<td>One or more fingers were lifted from the screen.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tapping</td>
					<td>A finger came down and up again but it is not sure yet if this may become a multi tap.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tapped</td>
					<td>There was no second tap within 250ms so this was a single tap gesture.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>DoubleTapped</td>
					<td>There have been two Tapping events within 250ms and no more came.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>LongPressing</td>
					<td>A finger came down on the screen and did not move. The finger is still down.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>LongPressed</td>
					<td>The finger was released and the gesture is finished.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Panning</td>
					<td>A finger came down and is moving on the screen.<br />This is also called a dragging gesture.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Panned</td>
					<td>The finger left the screen while it was moved slowly or not at all.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Swiped</td>
					<td>The finger left the screen while it was moved fast.<br />On Android and Windows Phone this is also called a flick.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pinching</td>
					<td>Two fingers hit the screen and are moving towards or away from each other.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pinched</td>
					<td>The fingers left the screen.</td>

					<td>Rotating</td>
					<td>Two fingers hit the screen and are rotating on the screen.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rotated</td>
					<td>The fingers left the screen.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>The -ing event is raised when at least one finger is on the screen and a gesture is in progress. The -ed event is raised, when the gesture is finished and all fingers left the screen.</p>

	<h3 id="EventArgs">EventArgs</h3>

	<p>Your event handlers will receive one of seven different <code>EventArgs</code> objects with all the detailed information what happened.</p>

	<p>
		Some elements need to listen to some touch gestures themselves to work properly. Depending on the exact implementation by Xamarin and the native platforms, these events may be consumed.<br>
		Some of the views are simply too small to be touched. Therefore the gestures are also not forwarded to us.
	</p>
    <p>
        <b>WPF:</b><br />
        When I tested the GestureSample with WPF the same happened again as on macOS; I found a bunch of very serious bugs.
        I filed them, they were acknowledged, but nothing happened ever since.<br />

        The bug which you see at once in the GestureSample is <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/3271">#3271</a>.
        The transformations from TranslationX/Y, Scale and Rotation are applied in the wrong order.
        So when you rotate an element by 90° and change TranslationX, then the element is moved vertically instead of horizontaly.
        Also when you set Scale to 2 and TranslationX to 100, it will be moved by 200.
        I'll see if I can fix this bug in Xamarin.Forms itself. It is no bug of MR.Gestures but it results in the GestureSample acting strange.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>MacOS:</b><br />
        Apple still has no multi touch displays for macOS, so I made the touch gestures on the Mac to work as I would expect them to.
        If you think anything is awkward or doesn't behave as you would expect, please let me know.<br />

        Down, Up, Tapping, Tapped, DoubleTapped, LongPressing, LongPressed, Panning, Panned and Swiped can be triggered with the mouse.
        For Pinching, Pinched, Rotating and Rotated you need a Trackpad and two or more fingers.
        Panning, Panned and Swiped can also be triggered with the Trackpad with two or more fingers.<br />

        As the Trackpad has coordinates of its own which are not related to the touched view at all,
        the Points in Touches work a bit different then on the other platforms / using the mouse.
        When I returned the coordinates of the Trackpad (which is recommended by Apple), the values were very small for Pan gestures.
        So I added <code>MR.Gestures.MacOS.Settings.TrackpadCoordinateRatio</code> and multiply all coordinates by that setting.
        The default is 5/5, but you can change it however you want to get bigger or smaller values for the Touches.<br />

        Apple also doesn't use the same coordinate system in MacOS as every other computer on earth.
        They have the 0/0 point at the LOWER left.
        So keep this in mind when you work with the view, touch or other coordinates.
        Most likely you'll have to do some different logic on the Mac than on the other platforms.
        Fortunately this is consistent with <code>Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.TranslationY</code> and other Y coordinates.<br />
        This also means that angles are counter clock wise instead of clock wise on every other platform.<br />

        There's also a bug in Xamarin.Forms.MacOS. Their PageRenderer and ScrollViewRenderer don't have virtual methods
        OnElementChanged and OnElementPropertyChanged to override. Therefore I cannot hook into those elements' touch handlers.
        I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/1187" target="_blank">PR</a> to Xamarin in October 2017
        and they merged it into master, but almost 10 months later it is still not included in XF 3.1.

    <h2 id="FAQs">FAQ</h2>

    <h3 id="HowToConfigureTheLicenseKey">How do I configure my license key?</h3>

    <p>
        As your app name can be different on each platform, the license key must be configured in all platform specific projects.
        The best place for it is in each project between the calls to <code>Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(...)</code> and <code>LoadApplication(new App())</code>.
    </p>

    <h5>Android</h5>
    <p>In your Android project open <code>MainActivity.cs</code> and in the <code>OnCreate</code> method after the call to <code>global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(...)</code> add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>MR.Gestures.Android.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";
</code></pre>

    <h5>iOS</h5>
    <p>In the iOS project this has to be done in <code>AppDelegate.cs</code>, in the <code>FinishedLaunching</code> method. Add this line:</p>

<pre><code>MR.Gestures.iOS.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";
</code></pre>

    <h5>Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight</h5>
    <p>In the Windows Phone 8.0 project that line has to be added to <code>MainPage.xaml.cs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>	global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();
	MR.Gestures.WinPhone.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";
</code></pre>

    <h5>Windows Runtime</h5>
    <p>In the Windows (Phone) 8.1 Runtime projects the right place is in <code>App.xaml.cs</code> in the <code>OnLaunched</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>                Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(e);
                MR.Gestures.WinRT.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";
                if (e.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated)
</code></pre>

    <h5>Universal Windows Platform</h5>
    <p>
        UWP is very similar to Windows Runtime. Therefore here you also add the code to the <code>OnLaunched</code> method in <code>App.xaml.cs</code>.<br />
        For the .NET Native compilation you also have to tell Xamarin.Forms, which assemblies it should scan for custom controls and renderers.
        Therefore you also have to change the call to <code>Forms.Init</code> slightly:
    </p>

<pre><code>                rootFrame.NavigationFailed += OnNavigationFailed;

                var otherAssemblies = new[] {
                    typeof(MR.Gestures.ContentPage).GetTypeInfo().Assembly,
                    typeof(MR.Gestures.UWP.Renderers.PageRenderer).GetTypeInfo().Assembly,
                };
                Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(e, otherAssemblies);

                MR.Gestures.UWP.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";

                if (e.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated)
</code></pre>

    <h5>MacOS</h5>
    <p>In the MacOS project, <code>Forms.Init</code> is called from <code>AppDelegate.DidFinishLaunching</code> and that's also where you set the <code>LicenseKey</code>:</p>

<pre><code>	Forms.Init();
	MR.Gestures.MacOS.Settings.LicenseKey = "&lt;your license key&gt;";
	LoadApplication(new App());
</code></pre>

    <h3 id="HowToConfigureAppName">How do I configure my app name?</h3>

    <p>The name of the app has to be configured differently on each platform.</p>

    <h5>Android</h5>

    <p>In the Android project open MainActivity.cs. The <code>MainActivity</code> class should have a <code>Activity</code> attribute. The <code>Label</code> parameter is the app name.</p>

    <p>If you configured your activity manually in the Properties / AndroidManifest.xml file, then you need to change the <code>android:label</code> attribute there.</p>

    <h5>iOS</h5>

    <p>In Visual Studio open the iOS project properties and go to the "iOS Application" tab. There you'll find the "Application name". If you don't have a "iOS application" tab, then open the info.plist. The app name is in the CFBundleDisplayName or CFBundleName setting.</p>
    <p>In Xamarin Studio the "Application name" is the very first textbox when you open the info.plist file.</p>

    <h5>Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight</h5>

    <p>In the Windows Phone 8.0 project open Properties / WMAppManifest.xml and on the "Application UI" tab change the "Display Name". You should also change the "Tile Title". This is the name which will be shown if you add the app to the start page.</p>

    <h5>Universal Windows Platform and Windows Runtime</h5>

    <p>
        On these platforms you need to open the Package.appxmanifest file in your platform project.
        On the "Application" tab change the "Display Name" and on the "Packaging" tab the "Package display name".
    </p>

    <h5>MacOS</h5>

    <p>In Visual Studio for Mac open the MacOS project options and go to General / Main Settings. You need to set the "Name".</p>

    <h3 id="InstallWithNuget">How do I install MR.Gestures?</h3>

    <p>You can install it with NuGet. In Visual Studio for Windows the easiest way is to right click your solution and choose "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...", then search for MR.Gestures and install it to all projects which use XF at once.</p>
    <p>On the Mac you need to install the package for each project separately.</p>

    <h3 id="TrialVersion">Is there a trial version available?</h3>

    <p>I already released the GestureSample app with complete source code on <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample">GitHub</a>. That app shows how to use MR.Gestures with each and every available Element.</p>
    <p>If you want to try it in your own app or the final name of your app has not been decided yet, you can simply call your app <i>GestureSample</i> and use the LicenseKey from that app.</p>

    <h3 id="EmptyEventArgs">My event handler is called, but some event arg properties are not set.</h3>

    <p>You did not set the <code>LicenseKey</code> properly or it does not match your app name. Please check if you set the correct <code>LicenseKey</code> in all platform specific projects and that your app name matches the key.</p>

    <h3 id="NotRaised">The <code>Tapped</code> and <code>DoubleTapped</code> events are not raised</h3>

    <p>Please check if you set the <code>LicenseKey</code> properly. Without <code>LicenseKey</code> the <code>NumberOfTaps</code> will always be 0. <code>Tapped</code> will only be raised if <code>NumberOfTaps</code> is 1 and <code>DoubleTapped</code> only if it is 2.</p>

    <h3 id="License">What's the license agreement of MR.Gestures?</h3>

    <p>
        MR.Gestures is a pet project for me. It is very cheap and I don't earn a lot.
        I definitely don't earn enough to hire a lawyer to write an official license agreement and I'm not a lawyer myself.
        Whatever I could write by my own would not hold before a court anyway, so I didn't want to do it.
        However, some people still ask for a license agreement so here is something that may at least satisfy your procurement.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote MR.Gestures myself and I hold all rights on it.<br />
        It is a library to be included in others apps, so Yes, I grant the right to use MR.Gestures in your own app, no matter if it's commercial or free.<br />
        I do not grant the right to tamper with the library in any way, disassemble or resell the whole or only parts of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        MR.Gestures is licensed per app name.
        I.e. if your app has the same name on all platforms, you only need one license key.
        If you have different versions of your app with different names (e.g. different languages, customized for different clients/environments or free and pro), then you need a separate key for each version.
    </p>
    <p>You can use it for as many developers on as many computers as you like.</p>

    <h3 id="MultiTouchGestures">I want to swipe with two fingers. How can I handle that gesture?</h3>

    <p>The native standard gesture recognizers only work with the standard amount of fingers. I.e. two fingers for pinch and rotate and one for the others.</p>
    <p>I managed to get some gestures on some platforms running with more fingers, but this is not consistent over all platforms.</p>
    <p>In the future I may use a different API which is nearer to the wire. But this is a very big change so I'm not sure if I'll do that yet.</p>

    <h3 id="Container">I try to move/zoom/rotate an element, but it jumps on the screen.</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>Touches</code> coordinates in the <code>EventArgs</code> are always relative to the <code>View</code> which handles the event.
        If you manipulate the <code>TranslationX</code>, <code>TranslationY</code>, <code>Scale</code> or <code>Rotation(X/Y)</code> properties during a gesture,
        then the <code>Touches</code> and <code>Delta*</code> values cannot be calculated anymore.
    </p>
    <p>So you always have to listen to the events of a container element and manipulate those properties of a child.</p>

    <p>So instead of</p>
    <div class="highlight highlight-xml">
        <pre>        &lt;<span class="pl-ent">mr</span><span class="pl-ent">:</span><span class="pl-ent">Image</span>
        <span class="pl-e">PanningCommand</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding PanningCommand}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
        <span class="pl-e">TranslationX</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding TranslationX}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
        <span class="pl-e">TranslationY</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding TranslationY}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> /&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>you should write</p>
    <div class="highlight highlight-xml">
        <pre>        &lt;<span class="pl-ent">mr</span><span class="pl-ent">:</span><span class="pl-ent">ContentView</span> <span class="pl-e">PanningCommand</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding PanningCommand}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="pl-ent">Image</span>
        <span class="pl-e">TranslationX</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding TranslationX}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
        <span class="pl-e">TranslationY</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>{Binding TranslationY}<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> /&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="pl-ent">mr</span><span class="pl-ent">:</span><span class="pl-ent">ContentView</span>&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <h3 id="WPCells">The gestures do not work on cells on Windows.</h3>

    <p>Xamarins Windows renderers (Silverlight, Runtime and UWP) for cells do not provide anything I can hook into to add my functionality. So I had to add that functionality to the renderers for <code>MR.Gestures.ListView</code> and <code>MR.Gestures.TableView</code>.</p>
    <p>So if you want to listen to touch gestures on cells, the containing <code>ListView</code> or <code>TableView</code> must also be used from <code>MR.Gestures</code> even if you don't add any gesture listeners on that element itself.</p>

    <h3 id="CouldNotLoad">I get &quot;Could not load file or assembly 'MR.Gestures'&quot; or &quot;Could not load type MR.Gestures...&quot;.</h3>

    <p>Please check your references. The portable project needs to reference MR.Gestures. The platform specific projects need references to MR.Gestures.<i>platform</i>.</p>
    <p>Please also check, if you set your <code>Settings.LicenseKey</code> like it is described <a href="#HowToConfigureTheLicenseKey">below</a>. If this is not set, then the linker may strip it out of your executable.</p>

    <h3 id="Data">What data do you have from me and what do you do with it?</h3>

    <p>I don't collect any data from people who are not my customers. I also don't send newsletters, so there's no need to unsubscribe anything.</p>
    <p>
        If you buy a MR.Gestures license, then my distributor will collect all data which they need to process the payment.
        Once the payment is done, I receive an email with your contacts (technical and payment), app name and issued license key. I do not receive your credit card number or any other sensitive information.
        I keep this data for future reference in case anybody needs support from me.
        Also if you send me any emails yourself, I will keep those emails for future reference.
        You can request the deletion of these emails, but if I can't find your data, then you're no customer of mine and I may be slower with support requests.
