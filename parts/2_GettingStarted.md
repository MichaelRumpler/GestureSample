## Getting Started
{: #GettingStarted }

If you just want to see how it works, then download the free [GestureSample app from GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample).
In this app you can see how all the elements use all events. You can change the code however you like, add break points and see what it does.
You will find all the examples from here in the GestureSample and many more.

To add MR.Gestures to your own app just follow these simple steps:

*   [Install MR.Gestures with NuGet](#InstallWithNuget)
*   [Obtain a license key](#Buy)
*   [Configure the license key(s) in each platform specific project](#HowToConfigureTheLicenseKey)

And now you can use the new elements from the namespace `MR.Gestures`.

If you don't want to buy a license yet, you can try without setting a `LicenseKey`. Some gestures are also raised without license, but the `EventArgs` will be empty.

You could also rename your app to GestureSample and use the `LicenseKey` from that app.
