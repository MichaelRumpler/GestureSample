{: #Contact }

My name is Michael Rumpler and I'm a freelance developer located in Austria. I started with C# in 2004. Although I also coded a lot in JavaScript, Java and some others, C# is my language of choice.

If you have any questions, suggestions, you find bugs or whatever, then please read this page again. If you can't find anything about your problem here, than search in the thread in the Xamarin forum I linked below.

If you still can't find anything, then you can contact me in various ways:

*   open an issue in [GestureSample/Issues](https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample/issues). I use that for both the GestureSample itself and MR.Gestures.
*   send an email to [mrgestures@mrumpler.at](mailto:mrgestures@mrumpler.at)
*   or a tweet [@MRGestures](https://twitter.com/MRGestures).
*   post to the [Xamarin Forum](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/32956/mr-gestures-handles-all-touch-gestures#latest)
