<p>
    Some elements need to listen to some touch gestures themselves to work properly. Depending on the exact implementation by Xamarin and the native platforms, these events may be consumed.<br>
    Some of the views are simply too small to be touched. Therefore the gestures are also not forwarded to us.
</p>
<p>
    <b>WPF:</b><br />
    When I tested the GestureSample with WPF the same happened again as on macOS; I found a bunch of very serious bugs.
    I filed them, they were acknowledged, but only one has been fixed yet.<br />

    The bug which you see at once in the GestureSample is <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/3271">#3271</a>.
    The transformations from TranslationX/Y, Scale and Rotation are applied in the wrong order.
    So when you rotate an element by 90Â° and change TranslationX, then the element is moved vertically instead of horizontaly.
    Also when you set Scale to 2 and TranslationX to 100, it will be moved by 200.
    This bug has been fixed, but the fix has not been released yet. I don't know, which Xamarin.Forms version will include it.
</p>

    <b>MacOS:</b><br />
    Apple still has no multi touch displays for macOS, so I made the touch gestures on the Mac to work as I would expect them to.
    If you think anything is awkward or doesn't behave as you would expect, please let me know.<br />

    Down, Up, Tapping, Tapped, DoubleTapped, LongPressing, LongPressed, Panning, Panned and Swiped can be triggered with the mouse.
    For Pinching, Pinched, Rotating and Rotated you need a Trackpad and two or more fingers.
    Panning, Panned and Swiped can also be triggered with the Trackpad with two or more fingers.<br />

    As the Trackpad has coordinates of its own which are not related to the touched view at all,
    the Points in Touches work a bit different then on the other platforms / using the mouse.
    When I returned the coordinates of the Trackpad (which is recommended by Apple), the values were very small for Pan gestures.
    So I added <code>MR.Gestures.MacOS.Settings.TrackpadCoordinateRatio</code> and multiply all coordinates by that setting.
    The default is 5/5, but you can change it however you want to get bigger or smaller values for the Touches.<br />

    Apple also doesn't use the same coordinate system in MacOS as every other computer on earth.
    They have the 0/0 point at the LOWER left.
    So keep this in mind when you work with the view, touch or other coordinates.
    Most likely you'll have to do some different logic on the Mac than on the other platforms.
    Fortunately this is consistent with <code>Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.TranslationY</code> and other Y coordinates.<br />
    This also means that angles are counter clock wise instead of clock wise on every other platform.<br />

    There's also a bug in Xamarin.Forms.MacOS. Their PageRenderer and ScrollViewRenderer don't have virtual methods
    OnElementChanged and OnElementPropertyChanged to override. Therefore I cannot hook into those elements' touch handlers.
    I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/1187" target="_blank">PR</a> to Xamarin in October 2017
    and they merged it into master, but almost 10 months later it is still not included in XF 3.1.
