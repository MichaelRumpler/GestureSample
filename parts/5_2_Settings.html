<p>
    You can configure the behavior of MR.Gestures with different static Settings classes.<br/>
    Some of those settings are the same for all platforms. These can be found in MR.Gestures.Settings.
    Platform dependant settings are in MR.Gestures.<i>platform</i>.Settings.

                If more than two taps come with less then this timeframe between them, neither Tapped nor DoubleTapped will be raised.
                It will only be indicated in TapEventArgs.NumberOfTaps in the Tapping event.
