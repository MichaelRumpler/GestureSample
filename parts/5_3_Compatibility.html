<h4 id="Compatibility-Maui">.NET MAUI</h4>
<p>
    Some elements need to listen to some gestures themselves to work properly. Depending on the exact implementation by Microsoft and the native platforms, these events may be consumed.<br>
    Some of the views are simply too small to be touched. Therefore the gestures are also not forwarded to us.
</p>

<p>
    .NET MAUI itself still has many bugs. I found some problems in the GestureSample, but I did not check for each one, if they are caused by me or MAUI.
    All events are raised on all platforms, but I didn't check all the details like
    if the <code>EventArgs</code> values are correct, all events are raised on all controls and if any functionality is missing.

    <b>MacOS:</b><br />
    Apple still has no multi touch displays for macOS, so I made the touch gestures on the Mac to work as I would expect them to.
    If you think anything is awkward or doesn't behave as you would expect, please let me know.<br />

    Down, Up, Tapping, Tapped, DoubleTapped, LongPressing, LongPressed, Panning, Panned, Swiped, MouseEntered, MouseMoved, MouseExited and ScrollWheelChanged can be triggered with the mouse.
    For Pinching, Pinched, Rotating and Rotated you need a Trackpad and two or more fingers.
    Panning, Panned and Swiped can also be triggered with the Trackpad with two or more fingers.<br />

    As the Trackpad has coordinates of its own which are not related to the touched view at all,
    the Points in Touches work a bit different then on the other platforms / using the mouse.
    When I returned the coordinates of the Trackpad (which is recommended by Apple), the values were very small for Pan gestures.
    So I added <code>MR.Gestures.MacOS.Settings.TrackpadCoordinateRatio</code> and multiply all coordinates by that setting.
    The default is 5/5, but you can change it however you want to get bigger or smaller values for the Touches.<br />

    Apple also doesn't use the usual coordinate system in MacOS. They have 0/0 at the LOWER left.
    So keep this in mind when you work with the view, touch or other coordinates.
    Most likely you'll have to do some different logic on the Mac than on the other platforms.
    Fortunately this is consistent with <code>VisualElement.TranslationY</code> and other Y coordinates.<br />
    This also means that angles are counter clock wise instead of clock wise on the other platforms.<br />

    There's also a bug in Xamarin.Forms.MacOS. Their ScrollViewRenderer doesn't have a virtual method
    OnElementChanged to override. Therefore I cannot hook into that elements' touch handlers.
    I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/1187" target="_blank">PR</a> to Xamarin in October 2017
    and they merged it, but somehow it got removed again.

    Here are all the elements and how they work in detail on each platform.
